##Historical data of prisoners in Sweden

This repo contains manually digitalized records of prisoners in Sweden, from the year 1838. The source is raw PDF files from the Swedish Bureau of Statistics.

Each subdirectory corresponds to one PDF file. The data files have been flattened. Any occurence of `_` in the column headers referes to a subheader in the original data (e.g. "Column Namne_M" refers to "Column Name" -> Men).
